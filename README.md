# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection_Python

**Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent transactions. The dataset provided includes transactions made by credit cards, with a focus on identifying anomalies or fraud. The primary goal is to explore and visualize the data to uncover patterns and trends related to fraudulent activities.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards. It includes anonymized features (V1 to V28) and two columns for time and amount. The target variable, `Class'.

## Data Exploration

### 1. Data Loading
python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv')

**Initial Data Exploration**
Display the first few rows of the dataset.
Check data types and basic statistics.
Analyze class distribution to understand the balance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Scaling Features: Standardize the 'Amount' and 'Time' columns.
**Handling Missing Values:** Checked for any missing values and handled accordingly.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Univariate Analysis: Explored the distribution of 'Amount' and 'Time' features.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigated the relationship between features and the target variable.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed the correlation between features and the target variable.
Time-Series Analysis: Examined transaction trends over time.

**Visualization**
Created visualizations to highlight key findings, such as distribution of transaction amounts, transaction frequency by hour, and class distribution.

**Findings and Insights**
Fraudulent Transactions: Identified patterns in fraudulent transactions, such as common transaction amounts and times.
Transaction Amounts: Analyzed how transaction amounts differ between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
Temporal Patterns: Observed any time-based patterns in transaction data, such as peak hours for fraudulent transactions.

**Recommendations**
Fraud Detection: Suggested monitoring transactions with unusually high amounts more closely.
Security Measures: Recommended additional security checks during times of high fraud activity.

**Conclusion**
This analysis provided valuable insights into credit card transactions and highlighted key patterns related to fraud. The visualizations and findings can assist in understanding fraudulent behaviors and improving fraud detection systems.

**Future Work**
Explore advanced machine learning techniques for fraud detection.
Implement additional feature engineering to enhance model performance.
Develop interactive dashboards to visualize real-time transaction data.
